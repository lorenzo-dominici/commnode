# Commnode
This project is part of my Thesis in Computer Engineering about *"Distributed Communication Architecture applied to Federated Learning"*.

## Documentation
The code documentation can be accessed by launching the following command in the project root directory.
```cargo doc --open```
This is necessary because the documentation has been written as doc comments together with the code, and the above command invokes the `rustdoc` features to build the documentation in html pages.

## Development
The development procedure, although it can be seen through the commits history, it has been written [here](/DEVELOPMENT.md) for an easier understanding.

## Experiment
The steps and configurations to reproduce the main experiment realized with this implementation are documented [here](/EXPERIMENT.md) to offer a simple example of what this implementation is capable of.
